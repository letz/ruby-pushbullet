        to solve the issue.\u003cp\u003eNobody has ever built a garbage collector
        that does not slow your program down or cause it to use vastly more resources
        than it would otherwise. (Claims to the contrary are always implicitly caveated).\u003cp\u003eGiven
        that this is the case, it really does start looking like a language issue.
        Yes you can rearchitect the GC to care more about locality, but you are just
        pushing the dust around on the floor: you will find a different problem.","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8979853"},{"active":true,"created":1.4227266561493518e+09,"modified":1.4227266561493518e+09,"type":"link","dismissed":false,"sender_name":"Jonathan

        control the GC and don''t even necessarily know what exactly drives the decisions
        it makes. So once you want to go beyond a certain level of performance, there
        is no right answer. You are just randomly trying stuff and kind of flailing.\u003cp\u003eIn
